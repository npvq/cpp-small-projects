## Notes:

Addition and Scalar Multiplication methods of vectors for polynomials are optimal. The `Polynomial` class also has operator overloading for `+`, `-`, `*`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `==`, `!=`. Subtraction and Multiplication use Addition and Scalar Multiplication, which are far from optimal (but for small polynomials this is no different from *polynomial* time, get the pun?). The multiplication operator is also overloaded with scalar multiplication
